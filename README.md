A rewrite of [wavesufer.js](https://github.com/wavesurfer-js/wavesurfer.js) in TypeScript with better performance.

Try it out:
```
npm install --save wavesurfer.js@alpha
```

Import from a CDN or a local file like this:

```
import WaveSurfer from 'https://unpkg.com/wavesurfer.js@alpha'
```

Or, as a script tag which exposes `WaveSurfer` as a global variable:
```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/wavesurfer.js@alpha"></script>
```

To import a plugin, e.g. the Timeline plugin:
```
import Timeline from 'https://unpkg.com/wavesurfer.js@alpha/dist/plugins/timeline.js'
```

TypeScript types are included in the package, so there's no need to install `@types/wavesurfer.js`.

## Why upgrade to wavesurfer.ts?

wavesurfer.js v7 (aka wavesurfer.ts) brings several improvements:

 * Typed API for better development experience
 * Enhanced decoding and rendering performance
 * New and improved plugins

## Plugins
The "official" plugins have been completely rewritten and enhanced:

 * [Regions](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#regions.js) ‚Äì now also replaces the old Markers plugin
 * [Timeline](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#timeline.js) ‚Äì displays notches and time labels below the waveform
 * [Minimap](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#minimap.js) ‚Äì a small waveform that serves as a scrollbar for the main waveform
 * [Envelope](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#envelope.js) ‚Äì a graphical interface to add fade-in and -out effects and control volume
 * [Record](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#record.js) ‚Äì records audio from the microphone and renders a waveform
 * [Spectrogram](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#spectrogram.js) ‚Äì visualization of an audio frequency spectrum

## CSS styling

wavesurfer.js v7 is rendered into a Shadow DOM tree. This isolates its CSS from the rest of the web page.
However, it's still possible to style various wavesurfer.js elements via CSS using the `::part()` pseudo-selector.
For example:

```css
#waveform ::part(cursor):before {
  content: 'üèÑ';
}
#waveform ::part(region) {
  font-family: fantasy;
}
```

You can see which elements you can style in the DOM inspector ‚Äì they will have a `part` attribute.

See [this example](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#styling.js) for play around with styling.

## Documentation
See the documentation on wavesurfer.js [methods](https://wavesurfer-ts.pages.dev/docs/classes/wavesurfer.WaveSurfer), [options](https://wavesurfer-ts.pages.dev/docs/types/wavesurfer.WaveSurferOptions) and [events](https://wavesurfer-ts.pages.dev/docs/types/wavesurfer.WaveSurferEvents) on our website.

## Migrating from v6 and lower

Most options, events, and methods are similar to those in previous versions.

### Notable differences
 * The `backend` option is removed ‚Äì HTML5 audio (or video) is the only playback mechanism. However, you can still connect wavesurfer to Web Audio via `MediaElementSourceNode`. See this [example](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#webaudio.js).
 * The Markers plugin is removed ‚Äì use the Regions plugin with `startTime` equal to `endTime`.
 * No Microphone plugn ‚Äì superseded by the new Record plugin with more features.
 * No Cursor and Playhead plugins yet ‚Äì to be done.

### Removed methods
 * `getFilters`, `setFilter` ‚Äì as there's no Web Audio "backend"
 * `drawBuffer` ‚Äì to redraw the waveform, use `setOptions` instead and pass new rendering options
 * `cancelAjax` ‚Äì ajax is replaced by `fetch`
 * `loadBlob` ‚Äì use `URL.createObjectURL()` to convert a blob to a URL and call `load(url)` instead
 * `skipForward`, `skipBackward`, `setPlayEnd` ‚Äì can be implemented using `setTime(time)`
 * `exportPCM` is renamed to `getDecodedData` and doesn't take any params
 * `toggleMute` is now called `setMuted(true | false)`
 * `setHeight`, `setWaveColor`, `setCursorColor`, etc. ‚Äì use `setOptions` with the corresponding params instead. E.g., `wavesurfer.setOptions({ height: 300, waveColor: '#abc' })`

See the complete [documentation of the new API](https://wavesurfer-ts.pages.dev/docs/modules/wavesurfer).

## Development

To get started with development, follow these steps:

 1. Install dev dependencies:

```
yarn
```

 2. Start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode and launch an HTTP server:

```
yarn start
```

This command will open http://localhost:9090/tutorial in your browser with live reload, allowing you to see the changes as you develop.
